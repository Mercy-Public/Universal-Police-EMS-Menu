### Installation
To install the script, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the script files.
2. Place the Mercy_Vanguard_001 file into your serverâ€™s resource directory.
3. Add the following line to your server configuration file (server.cfg): `ensure Mercy_Vanguard_001`
4. Customize the spawn locations and job items in the `config.lua` file to suit your server's needs.

### Configuration

The script comes with a customizable config file (`config.lua`). Here are some of the key settings you can adjust:

* **Spawn Locations**: You can add or modify spawn points for vehicle spawning. Each spawn point is identified by its name and coordinates.
* **Job-Specific Items**: You can define items for each job role. For example, police officers might get radios and handcuffs, while ambulance workers could receive first aid kits and defibrillators.

### Example Configurations

In the configuration file, you can define the spawn locations and items like this:

For spawn locations: `Station 1: Located at coordinates (-1061.95, -1420.94, 4.63, 344.18)` `Sandy Shores: Located at coordinates (1795.77, 3614.49, 34.28, 295.3)`

For items:

* **Police**: Includes items like a radio and handcuffs.
* **Ambulance**: Includes items like first aid kits and defibrillators.
